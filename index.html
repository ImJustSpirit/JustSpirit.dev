    <div class="about">
        <p>Hey, I'm Jack, and this is my website (although that's pretty obvious). I'm currently a <strong>Game Design and Development</strong> student based in <strong>Newcastle</strong>, with the intention of studying <strong>Games Programming</strong> at <strong>Teeside University.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Games in general have been a longtime love of mine, but while I <em>do</em> love the creative side (bar anything artistic; I just don't have the eye for it), coding has been my true calling for as long as I can remember. I've spent time learning web languages such as <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, while my latter school years were dedicated to <strong>Python</strong>. I'm currently in the process of teaching myself <strong>Godot</strong> with a mix of <strong>GDScript</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> in order to move away from Unreal Engine's <strong>Blueprints</strong> (no matter how satisfying they are to look at when done neatly).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Other than games, I like reading manga and watching the occasional anime. I <em>do</em> like going for walks, even if I don't go on them as often as I should. I watch far too much YouTube that I often struggle to find anything to watch on it now. And depending on how I'm feeling, I sometimes stream, and people laugh at me for dying in Elden Ring.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This website primarily serves as a place for my portfolio, where I can show off all the work I am proud of completing, or at least starting on, either solo or with friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I host basically everything I do over on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ImJustSpirit">GitHub</a>, and if you ever want to reach out to me, you can do so through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackcpetty/">LinkedIn</a>. </p>
