    <div class="about">
        <p>Hey, I'm Jack, and this is my website (although that's pretty obvious). I'm currently a <strong>Game Design and Development</strong> student based in <strong>Newcastle</strong>, with the intention of studying <strong>Games Programming</strong> at <strong>Teeside University.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Games in general have been a longtime love of mine, but while I <em>do</em> love the creative side (bar anything artistic; I just don't have the eye for it), coding has been my true calling for as long as I can remember. I've spent time learning web languages such as <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, while my latter school years were dedicated to <strong>Python</strong>. I'm currently in the process of teaching myself <strong>C++</strong> in order to move away from Unreal Engine's <strong>Blueprints</strong> (no matter how satisfying they are to look at when done neatly).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Other than games, I like reading manga and watching the occasional anime. I <em>do</em> like going for walks, even if I don't go on them as often as I should. I watch far too much YouTube that I often struggle to find anything to watch on it now. And depending on how I'm feeling, I sometimes stream, and people laugh at me for dying in Elden Ring.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This website serves as a place for many things: a review board for the latest games I've played or media I've watched; a place I can post a blog when I actually do something interesting for once (trust me, it's happening more often!); but most importantly, a place for my portfolio, where I can show off all the work I am proud of completing, or at least starting on, either solo or with friends.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I host basically everything I do over on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ImJustSpirit">GitHub</a>, and if you ever want to reach out to me, you can do so through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackcpetty/">LinkedIn</a>. </p>

            <div class="pieceText">Repacking is an important game jam to me, as it's the first one I entered with someone who is also interested in pursuing games and not just someone I pulled into doing it with me, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-luke-robinson-8b655928b/">Shane</a>. It's important for other reasons as well however, such as being my first game jam since entering college and learning Unreal Engine 5, and it was the first one that has any level of <em>presentability</em> to it. That being said, there isn't much to present, as we ended up backing out of the competition upon realising we wouldn't be able to complete our game in the designated time or to the standard we wanted to aim for. It was key in helping us realise where our flaws were, ones we may never have encountered by never doing any work outside of college.<br><br> The game itself centred around the player, whose job it was to pack boxes. At the start of the game, the player would be shown all the items they had to pack and would select the number and size of the boxes they would need to pack all the items. By doing so, the player would limit their space (adhering to the theme of <strong>limited space</strong>) and would be penalised for any remaining items that they were unable to pack.</div>

            <div class="pieceText">High Noon was the accumulation of one of the final assignments we got during our first year of college.
